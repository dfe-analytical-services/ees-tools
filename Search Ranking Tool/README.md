# Automated Search Ranking Tool

As part of our on-going efforts to improve our search results within the EES website, we have been tweaking the various parameters we have available to us. In order to know whether what we are tweaking is helping or hindering, we built this tool, which takes a search query and looks to see where our expected top result ranks. If all of our expected search results come first, then our work is done. Or the tool is broken.

## Usage

The tool is written in .net c# and is a commandline tool. There are two modes of operation, a single query mode and a csv file mode.

### Single Query Mode


### CSV File Mode
